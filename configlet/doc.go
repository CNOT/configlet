/*
Package configlet sanity-checks Exercism track configuration.

A track consists of a collection of problems in a single language. Each
problem has a test suite, an example solution, and any supporting files that
are necessary to solve the problem.

The configuration serves two purposes:

1. It helps implementors ensure that all the problems are valid.

2. It provides the API with a sort order for delivering problems.
