/*
Package configlet sanity-checks Exercism track configuration.

A track consists of a collection of exercises in a single programming language.
Each problem has a test suite, a sample solution, and any supporting files that
are necessary to solve the exercise.

The configuration serves two purposes:

1. It helps implementors ensure that all the exercises are valid.

2. It provides the API with a sort order for delivering exercises.
